# Session 6 Report: Dashboard + Holdings UI

**Date:** 2026-02-22
**Epic:** 6A — Dashboard + Holdings
**Mode:** PARALLEL (dashboard-engineer + holdings-engineer)
**Duration:** ~45 minutes

---

## What Was Planned

Build the two most important data-wired pages: the dashboard (portfolio overview with chart) and the holdings page (full sortable table). Replace Session 5 empty states with live data views consuming the Session 4 API endpoints.

### Scope (from SESSION-6-PLAN.md)
- Dashboard: hero metric, TradingView area chart, window selector, summary cards, compact holdings table, data health footer
- Holdings: sortable table with 8 columns, totals row, staleness indicators/banner, empty state transitions
- Shared: data fetching hooks, utility functions, TradingView integration

---

## What Was Delivered

### Dashboard Page (`/`)
- **HeroMetric** — Total portfolio value ($302K) in Crimson Pro 4xl, day change in dollar + percent with ValueChange coloring
- **PortfolioChart** — TradingView Lightweight Charts v5 area chart with gold gradient, dark theme, ResizeObserver for responsive width, empty state handling
- **WindowSelector** — PillToggle with 6 options (1D/1W/1M/3M/1Y/ALL), default 1M, triggers refetch of snapshot + timeseries
- **SummaryCards** — 3 cards: Total Gain/Loss (Decimal.js `add` for unrealized + realized), Unrealized PnL, Realized PnL
- **HoldingsTable compact** — Inline holdings table with 8 columns, no sort headers
- **DataHealthFooter** — Wired to live `/api/market/status`: instrument count, polling interval, budget usage, freshness/staleness

### Holdings Page (`/holdings`)
- **HoldingsTable full** — 8-column sortable table (click headers), default sort by value descending
- **TotalsRow** — Aggregate total value + total unrealized PnL
- **StalenessIndicator** — Amber Badge with relative time + Tooltip showing full date
- **StalenessBanner** — Conditional amber warning banner when any holdings are stale
- **Empty state transition** — HoldingsEmpty when no holdings, full table when data exists

### Infrastructure
- **4 data hooks:** usePortfolioSnapshot (window-reactive), usePortfolioTimeseries (date range), useHoldings, useMarketStatus
- **3 utility modules:** window-utils (date range mapping), chart-utils (TradingView data transform), holdings-utils (sort, allocation, totals, staleness)
- **Enriched seed:** 28 instruments (user's full portfolio), 30 transactions, 8300+ price bars, 3 intentionally stale quotes

### Lead Integration Fixes
- Fixed TradingView v5 API: `addSeries(AreaSeries, opts)` replaces removed `addAreaSeries()`
- Wired HoldingsTable compact into dashboard page
- Fixed PrismaSnapshotStore test (clean all snapshots in beforeEach, not just January range)

## Scope Cuts

None. All planned features were delivered.

---

## Blocking Issues Discovered

None.

### Minor Issue Fixed
- **PrismaSnapshotStore test fragility:** The `deleteFrom` test was sensitive to database state (only cleaned January snapshots, but `deleteFrom` deletes all future snapshots). Fixed by cleaning all snapshots in `beforeEach`.

## Architecture Decisions Made

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| AD-1 | Client-side `fetch` + `useState`/`useEffect`, no SWR | Minimal deps. Single user, no cache invalidation needed. |
| AD-2 | TradingView v5 with `useRef` lifecycle | Imperative chart API requires ref-based create/dispose pattern. |
| AD-3 | Window dates computed client-side | API already accepts window param on snapshot endpoint. |
| AD-4 | `Number()` exception only in chart-utils.ts | TradingView requires numeric values. All other display uses formatters. |
| AD-5 | Empty vs data states at page level | Simple conditional rendering, no loading spinner on zero data. |
| AD-6 | Holdings table fetched independently per page | No global state manager needed for <20 instruments. |
