# Session 9 Report — Full-Stack Validation + Polish + MVP Signoff

**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Session:** 9 of 9 (Final)
**Epics:** 8 (cross-validation completion) + 9 (polish)
**Mode:** Lead Phase 0 (blocking gate), then parallel teammates (validation-engineer + polish-engineer)

---

## Session Overview

Session 9 was the final session of the STOCKER project. Its sole objective was to verify every number is correct, every page works end-to-end, and the advisor produces useful responses against real data — then sign off the MVP. The session used a phased approach: a blocking lead gate (Phase 0) for live LLM verification, parallel teammates for validation and polish (Phases 1-2), and lead integration for final signoff (Phase 3).

All 10 exit criteria were met. The MVP is shipped.

## Work Completed

### Phase 0: Live LLM Verification + Smoke Test (Lead)

**Tool loop fix:** The tool execution loop in `packages/advisor/src/tool-loop.ts` used `??` (nullish coalescing) on the final response, which doesn't catch empty strings — only null/undefined. Changed to `||` so an empty LLM response gets the fallback message "I was unable to complete the analysis within the allowed number of steps."

**Anthropic adapter updates:**
- Default model changed from `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250514` to `claude-sonnet-4-6`
- Added `thinking: { type: 'adaptive' }` for Claude 4.6 adaptive thinking mode
- Increased `max_tokens` from 4096 to 16000 to accommodate thinking blocks
- Added comment to skip 'thinking' content blocks in response parsing

**Live LLM verification:** All 5 advisor intent categories verified against real Claude Sonnet 4.6 with seed data (28 instruments, 30 transactions, $302,885.71 total portfolio value):

| Intent | Tools Called | Result |
|--------|------------|--------|
| 1. Cross-holding synthesis | getPortfolioSnapshot, getQuotes | PASS — Rankings by PnL contribution |
| 2. Tax-aware reasoning | getHolding, getQuotes | PASS — Per-lot FIFO breakdown with gains |
| 3. Performance attribution | getPortfolioSnapshot, getHolding | PASS — Holding-level performance comparison |
| 4. Concentration awareness | getPortfolioSnapshot | PASS — Allocation analysis, threshold flagging |
| 5. Staleness/data quality | getPortfolioSnapshot, getQuotes | PASS — Freshness protocol applied |

No system prompt iteration was needed — all intents passed on first attempt.

**Full-stack smoke test:** 22 API endpoints verified working with correct response shapes and data.

### Phase 1: PnL Cross-Validation + Regression + Numeric Audit

**Cross-validation script** (`data/test/cross-validate.ts`): Three independent validation paths:
- Path A: Analytics engine validation against expected outputs (uses `@stalker/analytics`)
- Path B: Independent FIFO engine written from scratch (pure Decimal.js, no package imports)
- Path C: Engine vs independent consistency check
- Result: **749/749 checks passed**, zero failures

**Regression sweep:** 469/469 tests passing across 39 test files. TypeScript clean (zero errors).

**Numeric display audit** (`data/test/numeric-display-audit.md`): 23 files audited across UI components, format utilities, API routes, and validators. Zero violations found. One low-severity advisory: `formatNum()` in the advisor chat route uses `parseFloat(value.toFixed(2))` for LLM-facing text (not user-facing UI). Two approved exceptions: chart-utils.ts and chart-candlestick-utils.ts for TradingView.

### Phase 2: Accessibility + Documentation (polish-engineer)

**Focus trap:** Created `useFocusTrap.ts` hook — traps Tab/Shift+Tab within container, returns focus on deactivate. Wired into AdvisorPanel with `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, `aria-label="Portfolio Advisor"`.

**ARIA fixes:**
- Toast container: `role="status"`, `aria-live="polite"`
- DeleteConfirmation: `aria-describedby` linking to description paragraph
- UnpricedWarning: `role="alert"`
- Loading spinner: `role="status"`, `aria-label="Loading"`

**Documentation:** Created KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md documenting 8 MVP gaps with severity ratings.

### Phase 3: Integration + MVP Signoff (Lead)

**Build fix:** useFocusTrap.ts failed build under TypeScript strict mode (`'last' is possibly 'undefined'`). Fixed with non-null assertions (`!`) after length > 0 guard.

**Project documents updated:** CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, HANDOFF.md, Planning/STOCKER_MASTER-PLAN.md all reflect Session 9 completion and MVP status.

**MVP acceptance criteria:** All 21 criteria signed off (11 from Spec §13 + 10 from UX Plan §11.1).

## Technical Details

### Key Code Changes

**`packages/advisor/src/tool-loop.ts:94`** — Empty string coalescion:
```typescript
// Before: ?? doesn't catch empty strings
finalResponse: lastAssistant?.content ?? 'I was unable to...',
// After: || catches empty strings too
finalResponse: lastAssistant?.content || 'I was unable to...',
```

**`packages/advisor/src/anthropic-adapter.ts`** — Adaptive thinking:
```typescript
const response = await this.client.messages.create({
  model,
  max_tokens: maxTokens, // 16000 (was 4096)
  thinking: { type: 'adaptive' }, // NEW
  system: options?.systemPrompt ?? undefined,
  messages: anthropicMessages,
  tools: anthropicTools.length > 0 ? anthropicTools : undefined,
});
```

**`apps/web/src/lib/hooks/useFocusTrap.ts:33-34`** — Build fix:
```typescript
const first = focusable[0]!;  // Non-null assertion (length > 0 guard above)
const last = focusable[focusable.length - 1]!;
```

### Architecture Decisions

- **AD-S9a:** Adaptive thinking for advisor — `thinking: { type: 'adaptive' }` lets Claude decide when to use extended thinking. Requires max_tokens >= 16000.
- **AD-S9b:** `||` over `??` for string coalescion — intentional. Empty strings from LLM should trigger the fallback message, not be rendered as blank.

## Outstanding Items

None blocking. The following are documented in KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md and deferred to post-MVP:

- W-3: Snapshot rebuild outside Prisma transaction (data integrity risk under concurrent writes)
- W-4: GET /api/portfolio/snapshot side-effects on cold start
- W-5: Anthropic tool_result message translation workaround
- W-8: Decimal formatting truncation in advisor tool executors
- Symbol search, manual refresh, historical backfill stubs (need live API keys)
- No holiday/half-day market calendar
- No `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- No advisor context window management / summary generation

---

## Next Steps

1. **Wire live API keys** — Symbol search, manual quote refresh, historical price backfill (3 stubs ready)
2. **Bulk transaction paste input** — `POST /api/transactions/bulk` with tab-delimited paste and preview table
3. **CI pipeline** — GitHub Actions with test, build, type-check gates
4. **Holiday/half-day market calendar** — Reduce wasted API calls on market holidays
5. **Advisor context window management** — Token counting, summary generation for long threads
6. **`prefers-reduced-motion` support** — Respect user animation preferences
7. **Responsive refinements** — Tablet/mobile layout adjustments
8. **Performance profiling** — Identify and optimize slow paths
